# Datacenter Fires and Other "Minor" Disasters - Aja Hammerly
* Lessons learned
    * Automate everything
        * people are error prone at 1 in the morning
        * automate rollbacks as well
    * Always have a backup DB
    * Gracefully fallback if any of your external dependencies fail
        * without having to redeploy ideally
    * No silos
        * deployment pairing
        * infrastructure pairing
        * more than 1 person needs to know how to do any given thing
    * Disaster Recovery Plan
    * Cloud
    * If details matter, don't make any assumptions
    * Teams with diverse interests can save the day!
    * Being able to communicate clearly and honestly is hyper-important
    * Group ownership!
        * again: no silos
    * Postmortems
        * Blameless == assume everyone had good intentions

# Learning Fluency - Sara Simon
> "Building software is half strategy and half improvisation"

* The practiced skill is the daily dictation
    * with time fluency works, with intention it works faster
    * understanding doesn't build fluency; instead, fluency builds understanding.
    * discipline before imagination

* What's the algorithm for fluency?
    * learning is hard
    * learning is tedious
    * innovation appears out of hindsight
        * creativity and innovation both stem from an intense and intimate understanding of a system
    * the disregard of rote memorization is a failure of imagination
            * a refusal to trust our brains
