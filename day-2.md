# Finding your edge through a culture of feedback - Paulette Luftig

### A Culture of Feedback is:
* A culture in which people witness, support, even provoke one another to grow their capabilities and adapt challenges through practice

#### Giving Feedback
* Actionable Feedback
	* is about something the recipient has the ability to change
	* explains what the recipient is being asked to do differently
* Specific Feedback
	* focuses on impact - the action not the person
	* states what happened that was done well or not well
	* avoids absolutes like "always" and "never"
* Kind Feedback
	* discreet when appropriate
	* positively intended
	* timely
	* empathetic
	* unassuming
	* _there is one caveat about kindness in relation to feeback...kindness is a terrible reasonot to give important feedback._
* Questions to ask yourself before going into a feedback session:
	* How emotionally grounded am I?
	* How emotionally grounded is s/he?
	* Am I aware of my personal values, privileges, and biases?
	* Am I in a position of power and can I use it wisely?
	* Am I willing to have a conversation?
	* Can I respond with empathy? (**Not** sympathy)
