### It's on us and it's time to get to work! <3
------------------------------------------------

# Continuing education at work - Katherine Wu
### Technical Book Club
* 1 - 2 chapters of a technical book/week

### LunchConf
* Weekly meetup in-office, pick a 30 - 60 minute conference talk, and watch it over lunch

#### Why these are a good idea:
> > "All of the learning, none of the stress!" (doesn't feel like school)

* Why continuing education at work?
    * Notice all the gaps in your knowledge, before they become fatal flaws
    * User peer pressure on yourself
    * Active learning via engagement with the material alone, and then with others
    * Convenient
    * Take advantage of resources
    * Make material more relevant
    * Develop relationships
    * Set the discussion
        * getting agency over what people are exposed to at work

#### General Principles (EDU)
1. Make it easy
    - set the bar so low that it's hard not to do it
    - don't shoot for 100% participation every time/every week
2. Make it distributed
    - as decentralized as possible
    - document how things are being run
3. Make it useful
    - set up a positive feedback loop

#### Getting started
* Pick your own starting point
* Recruit participants - gather a core group
    * Get a difference in experience levels
    * Loop in mentors
* Pick a consistent time and location
* Discuss and set ground rules - create a micro-culture
    * Some examples:
        * "First rule of book club is....come to book club"
        * Talk about motivations - why are you here?
        * If two people are around, will meet
        * It's ok to disagree!
        * It's ok to leave a talk (lunchconf)
        * have a place to record things - wiki of some kind. google drive folder?

#### Running the events
* Moderating
    * Assign 2 moderators - decentralization in practice
    * commit to doing *all* the reading
    * try to bring work examples (when appropriate)
    * rotate assignments
* Have a forum for continued discussion
    * e.g. a slack channel


#### Resuscitating Attendance
* Ask questions
* Reset the bar
* Reminder of goals
